# Linear_Regression

Thinking deeper about linear regression
how you can envision minimizing loss, how the model can be used in various scenarios, and the importance of data.

What are some methods or tools that could be useful to consider when evaluating a linear regression output? 

There are many different tools that can be used to evaluate a linear regression model. Here are a few examples:
1.	Mean absolute error (MAE): This is measured by taking the average of the absolute difference between the actual values and the predictions. Ideally, this difference is minimal.
2.	Root mean square error (RMSE): This is similar MAE, but takes a slightly modified approach so values with large error receive a higher penalty. RMSE takes the square root of the average squared difference between the prediction and the actual value.
3.	Coefficient of determination or R-squared (R^2): This measures how well-observed outcomes are actually predicted by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes. Challenge yourself
